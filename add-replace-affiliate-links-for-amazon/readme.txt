Add & Replace Affiliate Links for Amazon plugin helps you to add or update Amazon Associate tag parameters in links.

The plugin automatically changes out shortened amazon links (e.g., amzn.to) that hide the Amazon Associate tag to a long-form link:

- **Short form:** [https://amzn.to](https://amzn.to)
- **Long form:** [https://www.amazon.com/dp/PRODUCTASIN?tag=TEST123-20](https://www.amazon.com/dp/PRODUCTASIN?tag=TEST123-20)
